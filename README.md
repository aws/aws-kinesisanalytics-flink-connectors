# AWS Kinesis Flink Connectors

This repository contains various Apache Flink connectors to connect to [AWS Kinesis][kinesis] data sources and sinks. 

## Flink Firehose Producer
The Firehose Producer allows Flink applications to push directly to [Kinesis Firehose][firehose].
- [AWS Documentation][firehose-documentation]
- [Issues][issues]

### Quickstart
Configure and instantiate a `FlinkKinesisFirehoseProducer`:

```java
Properties config = new Properties();
outputProperties.setProperty(ConsumerConfigConstants.AWS_REGION, region);

FlinkKinesisFirehoseProducer<String> sink = new FlinkKinesisFirehoseProducer<>(streamName, new SimpleStringSchema(), config);
```

### Getting Started
Follow the [example instructions][example] to create an end to end application:
- Write data into a [Kinesis Data Stream][kds]
- Process the streaming data using [Kinesis Data Analytics][kda]
- Write the results to a [Kinesis Firehose][firehose] using the `FlinkKinesisFirehoseProducer`
- Store the data in an [S3 Bucket][s3]

### Building from Source
